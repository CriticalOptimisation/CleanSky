<p>EDS stands for Eco Design for Systems. It is the name of a project financed by the European Commission in the seventh framework programme, in the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative. Among other things, EDS aims to develop integrated modelling tools enabling the development of optimised aircraft even in presence of technology breakthroughs or radically new architectures. The package EU_CleanSky has been created to aggregate all the open source, public Modelica models produced in Clean Sky. The EDS sub-package does the same for EDS related models.</p>
