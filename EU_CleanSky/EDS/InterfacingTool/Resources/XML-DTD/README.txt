DTDs are used for basic database syntax and structure check by many XML editors.

The DTD are also less verbose, and Visual Studio can automatically create an XML Schema equivalent to a DTD, 
which is a good base to start adding detail.

XML schema files describe the same files in greater detail (defines the type of all elements).
